The developed DMAR algorithm solves it with provable guarantees of cost improvements over a greedy base policy (which is the only viable and probabilistically complete policy aside from DMAR).\nThe DecMAHR is considered even more powerful due to the fact that the execution is online and completely decentralized.

This research project that I started with Kirtus Leyba and Prof. Joshua Daymude aims to answer this question.\nWe are using the Self-organizing particle systems(SOPS) model developed at SOPS Lab(ASU) to study distributed collective algorithms. It consists of individual, homogeneous computational elements called particles which move along the vertices of a triangular lattice structure. The algorithms we develop are stochastic in nature and encode markov-chains that govern the movement dynamics of the particles. These algorithms only rely on local information available to the particles and operate in distributed paradigm.\nFor optimizing and searching for solution algorithms Genetic Algorithms are used. Genetic Algorithms provide for a heuristic based optimization which can balance out exploration and exploitation. We need such robustness and flexibility in optimization since we require our algorithms to be agnostic to the number of particles and find multiple solution algorithms if they exist.\n","date":1693094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693094400,"objectID":"1c3d996c799ba02c5f1bca951c4c91ec","permalink":"https://drparkar.github.io/project/ssops-ga/","publishdate":"2023-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ssops-ga/","section":"project","summary":"Using genetic algorithms to find distributed local algorithms that generate global collective behaviors","tags":["Complex Systems","Evolutionary Algorithms"],"title":"EvoSOPS: Evolving global collective behaviors using restricted agents","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Later I grew curious to see if there was a way to evolve dynamic behaviors just like nature does. I understood the power of neural networks and paired it with genetic algorithms to see if a dynamic robot controller could result in complex behaviors. I tested out a hypothesis that inter-dependent evolutionary pressures drives the complex behavior of communication to evolve in animals. I successfully managed to develop a nascent form of communication, where prey robots where able to alert other prey robots about predator robots in the vicinity.\nExperiments: ARGoS multi-robot simulator was used to conduct experiments on Foot-bot robots (part of Swarmanoid project) which had following capabilities:\nRGB LEDs Omnidirectional camera Proximity sensor It was observed that prey bots rotated about their axis and maintained equal distance from each other so as to increase the scope of detecting a predator bot. The predator bot evolved to chase a prey that was closest to it however due to wider vision it would usually end the chase pre-maturely. The preys evolved a nascent communication protocol whereby they started blinking whenever they were chased by a predator and were in the vicinity of other preys. Any prey bots which detected the signal moved away quickly and did the same to notify other prey bots. The experiments gave a proof of the earlier hypothesis and showed that neuro-evolutionary models can be used to build complex behaviors\n","date":1524441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524441600,"objectID":"8084ce7ee33498f53079cf14fe047bb6","permalink":"https://drparkar.github.io/project/neuro-evo-swarms/","publishdate":"2018-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neuro-evo-swarms/","section":"project","summary":"Explores evolutionary algorithms to build neural network robot controllers for building collective behaviors","tags":["Complex Systems","Neuro-Evolutionary Algorithms"],"title":"Neuro-Evolutionary Swarms","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jamison Weber","Dhanush Giriyan","Devendra R.
